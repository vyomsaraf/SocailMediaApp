# SocailMediaApp
This is a sample social Media App

In this app, I have used SwiftUI, Swift 5.0, Swifter and AVkit as main components. 

Utilized Swifter to create a backend server inside the app itself, using file systems. 
KFImage is used to render public Images from links and AVkit for rendering public Videos from links
This app utilizes async await instead of traditional closure approach. 
There are plenty of error handling done using do try catch. 
App has a very basic UI and some server related bugs or issues.
