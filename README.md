# SocailMediaApp
This is a sample social Media App

In this app, I have used SwiftUI, Swift 5.0, Swifter and AVkit as main components. 

- Utilized Swifter to create a backend server inside the app itself, using file systems. 
- KFImage is used to render public Images from links and AVkit for rendering public Videos from links
- This app utilizes async await instead of traditional closure approach. 
- There are plenty of error handling done using do try catch. 
- App has a very basic UI and some server related bugs or issues.
- App uses Navigation Stack and has taken navigation inspiration from WWDC 2022, navigation stack
- App has basic accessibility support added especially for voice over using siri
